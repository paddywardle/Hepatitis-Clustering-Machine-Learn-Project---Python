# Hepatitis Clustering Machine Learn Project - Python
 The 'hcvdat0' dataset from kaggle was used to create a clustering models (K means and Kmeans++) to predict whether someone had no disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis or fibrosis. Exploratory data analysis was also carried out on the dataset in the form of aggregate statistics and visualisations to draw conclusions about the data.
